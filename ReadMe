Description:
IMPORTANT: Parsing/Handling of starting parameters.
    * args[0] = Game Mode, you can use this to know that you code is running on the evaluation server (if this is the case args[0] = TR).
        If this is the case only a command line interface must be displayed.
	    Also, no JavaFX and Swing UI component and classes must be used/executed by your Client in any way IF args[0]=TR.
    * args[1] = Server url, will hold the server url which your client should use. Note, only use the server url
        supplied here as the url used by you during the development and by the evaluation server (for grading) is
	    NOT the same! args[1] enables your client to always get the correct one.
	* args[2] = Holds the game ID which your client should use. For testing purposes you can create a new one by accessing
	    http://swe.wst.univie.ac.at:18235/games with your web browser.
